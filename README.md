# Automad-Themes
A little collection of Themes for [Automad](http://automad.org/) - written by me or friendly contributors?

## IMPORTANT NOTE

For the Foundation theme I placed only four variables in the home.php so you get the idea how it's working. You can change the text of them in your backend (gui) or replace the placeholder text with further variables (@p(x)).

### Foundation

In combination of my two foundation extensions here https://github.com/B-iggy/Automad-Extensions you can bring foundation into Automad very easily.
